                    <p>
                        <strong>LastPost Journal</strong> is a premium, developer-focused publication built for
                        engineers, creators, and technologists who care about quality, depth, and clarity.
                        We publish thoughtfully written articles that go beyond surface-level tutorials —
                        diving deep into how things actually work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether you're a beginner learning your first framework or an experienced developer
                        building production systems, LastPost is designed to give you content that respects
                        your time and intelligence.

                    <ul class="fs-6">

                    <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">Why LastPost Exists</h2>
                    <p>
                        The internet is full of rushed content, copied tutorials, and shallow explanations.
                        LastPost exists to be the opposite of that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We believe good writing matters. We believe code should be explained, not just shown.
                        And we believe developers deserve platforms that treat their work seriously.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This journal is built to be calm, readable, and distraction-free — so you can focus
                        on learning and building.

                    <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">For Developers, By Developers</h2>
                    <p>
                        LastPost is written and maintained by developers who actively build software.
                        Everything you read here comes from hands-on experience — projects shipped,
                        bugs fixed, systems scaled, and lessons learned the hard way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We don’t chase trends. We focus on concepts and skills that last.
